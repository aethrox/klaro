## Overview
`Klaro` is an **autonomous AI agent** designed to solve the problem of neglected technical documentation. It works by autonomously navigating your codebase, performing deep logic analysis, and generating clear, professional, and up-to-date documentation (such as README files and API references) with minimal human intervention.

### ðŸ’¡ The Problem
Writing and maintaining documentation is a time-consuming, tedious, and often neglected task. This common issue leads to accumulated technical debt, slow project onboarding for new team members, and overall project inefficiency.

### ðŸš€ The Solution
Klaro automates the entire documentation process. It employs an advanced **Pure Python ReAct loop** coupled with custom analysis tools and a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** to ensure the generated documentation is not only accurate but also adheres to specified project style guides.

## âœ¨ Core Features (Completed & Planned)
* **Autonomous Code Analysis:** Implemented using **Python's AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)** to read the entire file tree, identify key logic (classes, functions), and extract structured data for analysis.
* **Style Guide Integration (RAG):** **(Completed in Stage 3)** Learns from your existing project style guides or reference documents, retrieving relevant context from a vector database to match the tone, structure, and style of the final documentation.
* **Multi-Tool Orchestration:** Uses a **Pure Python ReAct** (Reasoning and Acting) loop to dynamically plan steps, execute custom tools (`list_files`, `analyze_code`, `web_search`), and self-correct errors during the documentation process.
* **Multi-Format Output (Planned):** Generates professional Markdown (`README.md`), API references, and more.
* **Smart Model Steering (Planned):** Will utilize LangGraph for dynamic model routing (e.g., using GPT-4o mini for file listing and GPT-4o for complex analysis) to optimize API costs.

## ðŸ›  Technology Stack
* **Core:** Python 3.11+ (Current stable version)
* **AI Framework:** LangChain (Tools & Prompts) & **LangGraph (Agent Orchestration)**
* **Agent Core:** LangGraph State Machine (Stage 4 Completed)
* **Vector DB/RAG:** ChromaDB, OpenAI Embeddings
* **Code Analysis:** `ast` (Abstract Syntax Tree)

## ðŸš§ Status: Under Active Development
This project is currently in active development, having completed **Stages 2 (Agent Core)**, **3 (RAG/Quality)**, and **4 (LangGraph Integration)** of the roadmap.
