## Overview

`Klaro` is an AI agent that autonomously reads your entire codebase, understands its logic, and generates clear, professional, and up-to-date technical documentation (such as README files, API references, and developer guides) with minimal human intervention.

### ðŸ’¡ The Problem

Writing and maintaining documentation is a time-consuming, tedious, and often neglected task. This leads to technical debt, slow adaptation processes, and inefficiency.

### ðŸš€ The Solution

Writing and maintaining documentation is a time-consuming, tedious, and often neglected task. This leads to technical debt, slow adaptation processes, and inefficiency.

## âœ¨ Features (Planned)

* **Autonomous Code Analysis:** Reads the entire file tree, identifies key logic, and understands the relationships between components.
* **Multi-Format Output:** Generates professional Markdown (`README.md`), API references, and more.
* **AI-Powered Understanding:** Utilizes the most advanced LLMs (GPT-4o mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, etc.) via LangChain and LangGraph for deep understanding of the code.
* **Smart Model Steering:** Uses inexpensive models for simple tasks (file listing) and powerful models for complex analysis (code summarization) to optimize costs.
* **Style Guide Integration (RAG):** (Step 3) Learns from your existing documents to match the tone and style of your project.

## ðŸ›  Technology Stack

* **Core:** Python 3.9+
* **AI Framework:** LangChain & LangGraph
* **Models:** GPT-4o mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Haiku (With Agentic Router)
* **Code Analysis:** `ast` (Abstract Syntax Tree), `GitPython`
* **Observability:** LangSmith
