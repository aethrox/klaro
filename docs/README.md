# Klaro Documentation Directory

This directory contains in-depth technical documentation for the Klaro project.

## üìö Documentation Structure

### Core Documentation

- **Project Roadmap** (`klaro_project_plan.md`) - Development stages, milestones, and strategic vision
- **Technical Design** (`tech_design_advanced_agent_langgraph.md`) - LangGraph architecture and design decisions
- **Custom Tools Design** (`tech_design_custom_tools.md`) - AST-based code analysis and tool specifications
- **Development Reports** (`development_report.md`) - Stage-by-stage implementation notes and learnings
- **Cost Analysis** (`klaro_tools_and_costs.md`) - API usage optimization and cost analysis

### Reference Documents

- **Style Guide** (`klaro_tech_docs_guide.md`) - Documentation standards and style guidelines
- **API Reference** - Detailed function and class documentation (future)
- **Architecture Diagrams** - Visual representations of system components (future)

## üìñ Reading Guide

### For New Contributors

1. Start with the **Project Roadmap** to understand the vision and completed stages
2. Read the **Technical Design** docs to grasp the LangGraph architecture
3. Review **Custom Tools Design** to understand AST analysis and tool implementation
4. Check **Development Reports** for context on architectural decisions

### For Users

1. Begin with the main [README.md](../README.md) for setup and usage
2. Refer to **Style Guide** to customize documentation output
3. Review **Cost Analysis** for API usage optimization tips

### For Researchers

1. Read **Technical Design** docs for architectural insights
2. Study **Custom Tools Design** for AST-based semantic analysis approach
3. Review **Development Reports** for evolution from ReAct to LangGraph

## üöß Status

This documentation directory is currently being organized. Some documents referenced above may be added in future releases as the project evolves.

**Current Priority:** Migrating internal design documents to this public directory while maintaining clarity and accessibility.

## üìù Contributing Documentation

Documentation contributions are highly valued! If you'd like to contribute:

1. Follow Markdown best practices
2. Include code examples where applicable
3. Add diagrams for complex concepts (Mermaid.js preferred)
4. Keep technical accuracy as the top priority
5. Ensure consistency with existing documentation tone

See the main [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for general contribution guidelines (future).
