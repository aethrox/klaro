# **Klaro Project: Technical Documentation User Guide**

## **1. Introduction**

This guide explains the purpose, target audience, and usage scenarios of the core technical design documents used during the development of the Klaro project. It is critical for the project team to follow these documents correctly to maintain a consistent vision and ensure every developer understands the different layers of the project.

The documents listed below are designed as a cohesive set, spanning from the project's overall vision to its deepest technical details.

## **2. Documents and Usage Instructions**

### **Document 1: Autonomous Documentation Agent: Project Plan**

* **File Name:** klaro_project_plan
* **Purpose:** A high-level document explaining the "why" and "what" of the project. It summarizes the business objectives, vision, target audience, and development roadmap.
* **Target Audience:** Project managers, product owners, stakeholders, and anyone new to the team.
* **Usage Scenarios:**
  * **For New Team Members:** This is the **first document** to read to understand the project's purpose and goals.
  * **Roadmap Tracking:** Use this to track the objectives and timelines of development stages (MVP, Stage 2, etc.).
  * **Presentation and Reporting:** Use as a reference when presenting to stakeholders about the project.

### **Document 2: Technical Design - Custom Agent Tools**

* **File Name:** tech_design_custom_tools
* **Purpose:** A technical document defining how the agent interacts with the external world (codebase). It details the architecture, functions, and expected outputs of CodebaseReaderTool and CodeAnalyzerTool.
* **Target Audience:** Software engineers developing the agent's core capabilities (code reading, analysis).
* **Usage Scenarios:**
  * **Development:** This document should be used as a specification when coding the CodebaseReaderTool and CodeAnalyzerTool classes.
  * **Debugging:** When tools exhibit unexpected behavior, refer to this document to verify expected input/output formats.
  * **Extension:** When adding new "capabilities" to the agent (e.g., a database schema reading tool), reference the design principles of existing tools from this document.

### **Document 3: Technical Design - Agent Architecture and Integration**

* **File Name:** tech_design_agent_architecture
* **Purpose:** Explains how the agent's "brain" works. Defines how it decides which tools to use (ReAct architecture), the system prompt, and the core Thought -> Action -> Observation loop.
* **Target Audience:** AI engineers and developers working on the agent's decision-making logic.
* **Usage Scenarios:**
  * **MVP Development:** Used when setting up the ReAct agent and creating the main AgentExecutor in Stages 1 and 2 of the project.
  * **Prompt Engineering:** Refer to this document when making changes to the system prompt to improve agent behavior.
  * **Flow Analysis:** Use this to understand why the agent selected a particular tool or why it got stuck in a loop.

### **Document 4: Technical Design - Advanced Agent Architecture (LangGraph)**

* **File Name:** tech_design_advanced_agent_langgraph
* **Purpose:** Outlines the plan for the project's future, more robust and fault-tolerant version. Explains the reasons for transitioning from ReAct to LangGraph and how this new architecture (State, Nodes, Edges) should be designed.
* **Target Audience:** Senior developers, system architects, and those responsible for the project's long-term technical vision.
* **Usage Scenarios:**
  * **Future Planning:** When progressing to Stage 4 of the project, this document will serve as the main guide for LangGraph implementation.
  * **Complex Scenarios:** Refer to this design when the agent needs capabilities such as error management, cyclical logic, and more complex task flows.

## **3. Recommended Reading Order**

For a developer to fully understand the project, it is recommended to read the documents in the following order:

1. **Project Plan:** "What are we doing and why?"
2. **Custom Agent Tools:** "How do the agent's 'hands' and 'eyes' work?"
3. **Agent Architecture:** "How does the agent's 'brain' use these 'hands' and 'eyes'?"
4. **Advanced Agent Architecture:** "How will we make this 'brain' smarter and more robust in the future?"
