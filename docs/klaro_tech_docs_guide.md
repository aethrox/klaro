# **Klaro Project: Technical Documentation Usage Guide**

## **1. Introduction**

This guide explains the purpose, target audience, and usage scenarios of the core technical design documents used during the development of the Klaro project. It is critical for the project team to follow these documents correctly to ensure consistent progress and comprehensive understanding of the project's various layers by all developers.

The documents listed below are designed as a cohesive whole, ranging from the project's general vision to the deepest technical details.

## **2. Documents and Usage Instructions**

### **Document 1: Autonomous Documentation Agent: Project Plan**

* **File Name:** klaro_project_plan
* **Purpose:** A high-level document explaining the "why" and "what" of the project. It summarizes the project's business objectives, vision, target audience, and development roadmap.
* **Target Audience:** Project managers, product owners, stakeholders, and anyone new to the team.
* **Usage Scenarios:**
  * **For New Team Members:** This is the **first document** to read to understand the project's purpose and goals.
  * **Roadmap Tracking:** Used to track development stage goals (MVP, Stage 2, etc.) and timelines.
  * **Presentations and Reporting:** Serves as a reference when presenting the project to stakeholders.

### **Document 2: Technical Design - Custom Agent Tools**

* **File Name:** tech_design_custom_tools
* **Purpose:** A technical document defining how the agent interacts with the external world (codebase). It details the architecture, functions, and expected outputs of CodebaseReaderTool and CodeAnalyzerTool.
* **Target Audience:** Software engineers who will develop the agent's core capabilities (code reading, analysis).
* **Usage Scenarios:**
  * **Development:** This document should be used as a specification when coding the CodebaseReaderTool and CodeAnalyzerTool classes.
  * **Debugging:** When tools exhibit unexpected behavior, refer to this to verify expected input/output formats.
  * **Extension:** When adding new capabilities to the agent (e.g., a tool to read database schemas), reference the design principles of existing tools from this document.

### **Document 3: Technical Design - Agent Architecture and Integration**

* **File Name:** tech_design_agent_architecture
* **Purpose:** Explains how the agent's "brain" works. Defines how it decides which tools to use (ReAct architecture), the system prompt, and the core Thought -> Action -> Observation loop.
* **Target Audience:** AI engineers and developers working on the agent's decision-making logic.
* **Usage Scenarios:**
  * **MVP Development:** Used during Stages 1 and 2 of the project when setting up the ReAct agent and building the main AgentExecutor.
  * **Prompt Engineering:** Refer to this document when making changes to the system prompt to improve the agent's behavior.
  * **Flow Analysis:** Used to understand why the agent chose a particular tool or why it got stuck in a loop.

### **Document 4: Technical Design - Advanced Agent Architecture (LangGraph)**

* **File Name:** tech_design_advanced_agent_langgraph
* **Purpose:** Outlines the plan for the project's future, more robust and error-tolerant version. Explains the reasons for transitioning from ReAct to LangGraph and how this new architecture (State, Nodes, Edges) should be designed.
* **Target Audience:** Senior developers, system architects, and those responsible for the project's long-term technical vision.
* **Usage Scenarios:**
  * **Future Planning:** When transitioning to Stage 4 of the project, this document will serve as the main guide for LangGraph implementation.
  * **Complex Scenarios:** When the agent needs to gain capabilities like error handling, cyclical logic, and more complex task flows, refer to this design.

## **3. Recommended Reading Order**

For a developer to fully understand the project, it is recommended to read the documents in the following order:

1. **Project Plan:** "What are we building and why?"
2. **Custom Agent Tools:** "How do the agent's 'hands' and 'eyes' work?"
3. **Agent Architecture:** "How does the agent's 'brain' use these 'hands' and 'eyes'?"
4. **Advanced Agent Architecture:** "How will we make this 'brain' smarter and more robust in the future?"
