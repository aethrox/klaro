# **Autonomous Documentation Agent: Project Plan and Technical Design**

## **Project Identity: Klaro**

### **Name: Klaro**

The name Klaro is derived from the Latin word **"clarus"** meaning "clear", "bright" and "luminous". This name perfectly reflects the project's core mission: to illuminate complex and hard-to-understand codebases and transform them into clear and understandable documentation for everyone. Klaro brings clarity to code.

### **Slogan**

**Klaro: From Code to Clarity. Instantly.**

## **1. Project Overview**

### **1.1. Problem**

Creating and maintaining documentation in software development processes is a time-consuming, tedious, and often neglected step, despite being critically important. Missing or outdated documentation makes it difficult for new team members to adapt to the project, slows down code maintenance, and reduces the overall quality of the project.

### **1.2. Solution**

This project aims to develop a "Documentation Agent" that autonomously analyzes a codebase and produces high-quality technical documentation (README.md, API references, developer guides, etc.) using Large Language Models (LLMs) and LangChain agent architecture. The agent will automate the documentation process with minimal developer intervention and increase efficiency.

### **1.3. Target Audience**

* Individual software developers
* Software development teams and companies
* Open source project managers

### **1.4. Value Proposition**

* **Time Savings:** Reduces manual documentation writing time by up to 90%.
* **Quality and Consistency:** Produces professional and standards-compliant documents across the project.
* **Easy Maintenance:** Facilitates updating documentation in parallel with changes in the codebase.
* **Developer Productivity:** Allows developers to spend more time on their main focus: writing code.

## **2. Technical Architecture and Components**

The agent will be built on LangChain's modular structure and consist of the following core components.

| Component | Technology/LangChain Module | Responsibility and Function |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Agent** | langchain.agents (ReAct, etc.) | The project's brain. Breaks down tasks into sub-steps, decides which tool to use when, and manages the overall workflow. |
| **Large Language Model (LLM)** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet / GPT-4o | Performs core intelligence tasks such as understanding complex code structures, reasoning, summarization, and text generation. |
| **Tools** | langchain.tools (Custom Tools) | The capability set that enables the agent to interact with the external world. |
| * - CodebaseReaderTool* | Custom Tool (Python os, git) | Clones a specified Git repository or reads all relevant code files (.py, .js, etc.) in a local directory and presents their content to the agent. |
| * - CodeAnalyzerTool* | Custom Tool (AST, LLM Chain) | Analyzes a piece of code (function, class); structurally extracts its purpose, parameters, return value, and dependencies. |
| * - WebSearchTool* | DuckDuckGo, SerpAPI, etc. | Performs web searches to gather information about external libraries or frameworks used by the project. |
| **RAG Mechanism** | langchain.vectorstores, RetrievalQA | Ensures that the generated text is consistent and in the desired tone by referencing the company's existing style guide or documentation examples from similar projects. |
| **Vector Database** | ChromaDB / FAISS | Stores vector embeddings of reference documents (style guides, examples) for RAG and enables fast semantic search. |
| **Output Parser** | langchain.output_parsers | Converts the raw text generated by the LLM into a specific and structural format like Markdown (e.g., a complete README.md file). |

## **3. Agent Workflow (Example: README Generation)**

1. **Input:** The user gives the agent a command: "Create a README.md file for the Python project at https://github.com/user/project-name."
2. **Planning (Reasoning):** The agent breaks down the main goal into sub-tasks:
   * "First, I need to access the codebase." -> CodebaseReaderTool
   * "To understand the project's general purpose, I should find and analyze main files (e.g., main.py, app.py)." -> CodeAnalyzerTool
   * "I should find and list the project's dependencies (requirements.txt)." -> CodebaseReaderTool
   * "I should explain how the project is installed and run."
   * "I should summarize what the main functions or API endpoints do." -> CodeAnalyzerTool
   * "I should combine all this information and create a draft in standard README format."
   * "Finally, I should convert the draft into final Markdown format." -> Output Parser
3. **Execution:**
   * The agent calls CodebaseReaderTool to clone the Git repository and read all .py files.
   * It reads the requirements.txt file and formulates an installation command like pip install -r requirements.txt.
   * With the help of the LLM, it identifies the project's main entry point and analyzes the main functions or classes in that file with CodeAnalyzerTool.
   * It generates short and understandable explanations for each main component.
   * If it detects a library like boto3, it can use WebSearchTool to research what this library does and add a note like "provides integration with AWS".
   * It brings together all the collected information (project purpose, installation, usage, API summary).
4. **Output:** The agent produces and presents to the user a formatted, complete README.md file like the following using the Output Parser.

## **4. Development Roadmap**

### **Stage 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product) - (1-2 Weeks)**

* **Goal:** An agent that creates a basic README.md for a single Python script.
* **Steps:**
  1. Integrate LangChain and LLM (Claude 3.5 Sonnet).
  2. Develop a simple CodeReaderTool that only reads a local file.
  3. Create a simple chain that takes file content and asks the LLM "What does this code do? Summarize."
  4. Add an Output Parser that formats the output as Markdown.

### **Stage 2: Advanced Analysis and Tool Integration - (2-3 Weeks)**

* **Goal:** An agent that analyzes an entire project and produces more detailed documentation.
* **Steps:**
  1. Develop CodebaseReaderTool to clone a Git repository.
  2. Create CodeAnalyzerTool that uses AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) to understand code structure.
  3. Integrate WebSearchTool.
  4. Strengthen the agent's planning and reasoning capabilities with ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) logic.

### **Stage 3: RAG and Quality Improvement - (2 Weeks)**

* **Goal:** An agent that produces more consistent documents that conform to a specific style guide.
* **Steps:**
  1. Set up a vector database (ChromaDB) for sample documents and style guides.
  2. Enrich the document generation step with a RAG mechanism.
  3. Perform prompt engineering to improve the quality of the agent's output.

### **Stage 4: Stabilization and LangGraph - (Optional, 3+ Weeks)**

* **Goal:** A more stable agent architecture capable of error handling and cyclical operations.
* **Steps:**
  1. Migrate the existing agent logic to LangGraph, a stateful structure.
  2. Add cycles that allow the agent to go back and try a different tool when it takes a faulty step.

## **5. Commercialization Ideas**

* **GitHub App:** A bot that automatically adds documentation to projects via Pull Request (PR).
* **SaaS Platform:** A web application where users can connect their Git repositories and instantly get documentation.
* **VS Code Extension:** A tool that enables developers to generate documentation for the file or function they're working on directly from within their IDE.
