# **Autonomous Documentation Agent: Project Plan and Technical Design**

## **Project Identity: Klaro**

### **Name: Klaro**

The name Klaro is derived from the Latin word **"clarus,"** meaning "clear," "bright," and "luminous." This name perfectly reflects the project's core mission: to illuminate complex and difficult-to-understand codebases and transform them into clear, understandable documentation for everyone. Klaro brings clarity to code.

### **Tagline**

**Klaro: From Code to Clarity. Instantly.**

## **1. Project Overview**

### **1.1. Problem**

In software development processes, creating and maintaining documentation is critically important yet often time-consuming, tedious, and neglected. Missing or outdated documentation makes it difficult for new team members to adapt to the project, slows down code maintenance, and reduces overall project quality.

### **1.2. Solution**

This project aims to develop a "Documentation Agent" that autonomously analyzes codebases and produces high-quality technical documentation (README.md, API references, developer guides, etc.) using Large Language Models (LLMs) and LangChain agent architecture. The agent will automate the documentation process with minimal developer intervention, increasing efficiency.

### **1.3. Target Audience**

* Individual software developers
* Software development teams and companies
* Open-source project maintainers

### **1.4. Value Proposition**

* **Time Savings:** Reduces manual documentation writing time by up to 90%.
* **Quality and Consistency:** Produces professional, standards-compliant documents across the project.
* **Easy Maintenance:** Facilitates updating documentation in parallel with codebase changes.
* **Developer Productivity:** Allows developers to spend more time on their primary focus: writing code.

## **2. Technical Architecture and Components**

The agent will be built on LangChain's modular structure and consist of the following core components.

| Component | Technology/LangChain Module | Responsibility and Function |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Agent** | langchain.agents (ReAct, etc.) | The brain of the project. Breaks down tasks into sub-steps, decides which tool to use when, and manages the overall workflow. |
| **Large Language Model (LLM)** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet / GPT-4o | Performs core intelligence tasks such as understanding complex code structures, reasoning, summarization, and text generation. |
| **Tools** | langchain.tools (Custom Tools) | The capability set that enables the agent to interact with the external world. |
| * - CodebaseReaderTool* | Custom Tool (Python os, git) | Clones a specified Git repository or reads all relevant code files (.py, .js, etc.) from a local directory and presents the content to the agent. |
| * - CodeAnalyzerTool* | Custom Tool (AST, LLM Chain) | Analyzes a code segment (function, class); structurally extracts its purpose, parameters, return value, and dependencies. |
| * - WebSearchTool* | DuckDuckGo, SerpAPI, etc. | Performs web searches to gather information about external libraries or frameworks used by the project. |
| **RAG Mechanism** | langchain.vectorstores, RetrievalQA | References the company's existing style guides or documentation examples from similar projects to ensure generated text is consistent and in the desired tone. |
| **Vector Database** | ChromaDB / FAISS | Stores vector embeddings of reference documents (style guides, examples) for RAG and enables fast semantic search. |
| **Output Parser** | langchain.output_parsers | Converts raw text generated by the LLM into specific structural formats such as Markdown (e.g., a complete README.md file). |

## **3. Agent Workflow (Example: README Generation)**

1. **Input:** User gives a command to the agent: "Create a README.md file for the Python project at https://github.com/user/project-name."
2. **Planning (Reasoning):** Agent breaks down the main goal into sub-tasks:
   * "First, I need to access the codebase." -> CodebaseReaderTool
   * "To understand the project's general purpose, I need to find and analyze main files (e.g., main.py, app.py)." -> CodeAnalyzerTool
   * "I need to find and list the project's dependencies (requirements.txt)." -> CodebaseReaderTool
   * "I need to explain how the project should be installed and run."
   * "I need to summarize what the main functions or API endpoints do." -> CodeAnalyzerTool
   * "I need to combine all this information and create a draft in standard README format."
   * "Finally, I need to convert the draft to final Markdown format." -> Output Parser
3. **Execution:**
   * Agent calls CodebaseReaderTool to clone the Git repository and read all .py files.
   * Reads requirements.txt and formulates an installation command like pip install -r requirements.txt.
   * With LLM's help, identifies the project's main entry point and analyzes main functions or classes in that file using CodeAnalyzerTool.
   * Generates short, understandable explanations for each main component.
   * If it detects a library like boto3, it can research what this library does using WebSearchTool and add a note like "provides AWS integration."
   * Combines all collected information (project purpose, installation, usage, API summary).
4. **Output:** The agent uses Output Parser to produce a complete, formatted README.md file like the one below and presents it to the user.

## **4. Development Roadmap**

### **Stage 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product) - (1-2 Weeks)**

* **Goal:** An agent that creates a basic README.md for a single Python script.
* **Steps:**
  1. Integrate LangChain and LLM (Claude 3.5 Sonnet).
  2. Develop a simple CodeReaderTool that reads only a local file.
  3. Create a simple chain that takes file content and asks the LLM "What does this code do? Summarize it."
  4. Add an Output Parser that formats the output as Markdown.

### **Stage 2: Advanced Analysis and Tool Integration - (2-3 Weeks)**

* **Goal:** An agent that analyzes an entire project and produces more detailed documentation.
* **Steps:**
  1. Develop CodebaseReaderTool to clone a Git repository.
  2. Create CodeAnalyzerTool that uses AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) to understand code structure.
  3. Integrate WebSearchTool.
  4. Strengthen the agent's planning and reasoning capabilities with ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) logic.

### **Stage 3: RAG and Quality Improvement - (2 Weeks)**

* **Goal:** An agent that produces more consistent documents compliant with a specific style guide.
* **Steps:**
  1. Set up a vector database (ChromaDB) for sample documents and style guides.
  2. Enrich the document generation step with RAG mechanism.
  3. Perform prompt engineering to improve the quality of agent-generated outputs.

### **Stage 4: Stabilization and LangGraph - (Optional, 3+ Weeks)**

* **Goal:** A more stable agent architecture capable of error management and cyclical behavior.
* **Steps:**
  1. Migrate existing agent logic to LangGraph, a stateful structure.
  2. Add cycles that allow the agent to backtrack and try a different tool when it makes a wrong step.

## **5. Commercialization Ideas**

* **GitHub App:** A bot that automatically adds documentation to projects via Pull Requests (PRs).
* **SaaS Platform:** A web application where users can connect their Git repositories and instantly receive documentation.
* **VS Code Extension:** A tool that enables developers to generate documentation for the file or function they're working on directly within the IDE.
