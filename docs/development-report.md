# **Klaro Project: Development Stages Report (Current Status)**

This report summarizes all progress, technical achievements, and architectural necessities of the Klaro project from its inception (MVP) to the latest LangGraph stabilization.

## **Stage 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and Basic Setup**

**Goal:** Prove the project's viability and establish the basic LLM chain.

| Achievement | Description | Technical Detail |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Agent Architecture** | A simple LangChain Chain was used to establish the first interaction with the LLM. | Passive, predefined flow of steps. No state management. |
| **Basic Tools** | Simple I/O tools like read_file were designed. | Inefficient reading methods that stressed the LLM's context window. |
| **Language Standard** | Decision made to **transition to English language standard** in preparation for international project. | All prompts, comments, and main variable names translated to English. |

## **Stage 2: ReAct Agent Architecture and AST Integration**

**Goal:** Move the agent to a ReAct (Thought → Action → Observation) structure capable of autonomous decision-making.

| Achievement | Description | Technical Detail |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Architecture Transition (ReAct)** | Due to persistent ImportError issues in LangChain, a **Pure Python ReAct Loop** was implemented. | The agent's logic loop was managed within main.py using parse_action function and while loop instead of external LangChain components. Stability achieved. |
| **Custom Tools** | Added list_files, read_file, web_search, and most importantly **analyze_code** (AST-based). | @tool decorators were removed from tools in tools.py (requirement for Pure ReAct) and presented to LLM as directly callable functions. |
| **Code Analysis Depth** | analyze_code used Python's **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)** library to transform code into structural (JSON) data. | LLM began understanding not just the text of code, but **class/function/parameter structure**. |

## **Stage 3: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and Quality Improvement**

**Goal:** Use external style guides to improve documentation output quality and consistency.

| Achievement | Description | Technical Detail |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **RAG Infrastructure Setup** | **ChromaDB** (Vector Database) and **OpenAI Embeddings** integration completed. | DEFAULT_GUIDE_CONTENT indexed with init_knowledge_base. retrieve_knowledge tool added. |
| **Output Control** | Agent **mandated** via system prompt to use retrieve_knowledge tool before writing README. | Generated READMEs guaranteed to follow the same professional format (Headings, Sections) every time. |
| **Final Output** | Klaro produced high-quality READMEs using both code analysis knowledge and mandatory Style Guide. |  |

## **Stage 4: LangGraph Architecture (Final Stabilization)**

**Goal:** Migrate the Pure Python ReAct loop to **LangGraph** designed for error management and flow control to make the project production-ready.

| Goal | Description | Technical Detail |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Architecture Transition (LangGraph)** | Despite all import crises (LangChain/LangGraph package incompatibilities), architecture moved to StateGraph structure. | Agent's memory (messages, errors) managed with LangGraph's AgentState structure. |
| **Stable Tool Calling** | Automatic tool calling system established using LangGraph's ToolNode and ToolExecutor structure. | Manual parse_action mechanism removed. Agent gained ability to replan after failed steps (decide_next_step router). |
| **Error Tolerance** | Thanks to LangGraph's Conditional Edges, agent gained ability to analyze state and **replan** instead of stopping the flow after a failed tool call. |  |

### **Conclusion and Project Vision**

The Klaro project has achieved its vision as an **autonomous, analytical, and style-aware** documentation agent. The project is working on its most stable architecture and is production-ready.
