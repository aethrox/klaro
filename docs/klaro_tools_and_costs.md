# **Klaro: Tools, Technologies, and Cost Analysis**

## **1. Introduction**

This document details the technical tools, libraries, services required for developing, testing, and potentially publishing the Klaro project, and their associated costs. The analysis covers the process from MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage to a full-fledged SaaS (Software as a Service) product.

## **2. Required Tools and Technologies (Technology Stack)**

### **2.1. Main Development Environment**

* **Programming Language:** Python (3.9+)
* **Framework:** LangChain, LangGraph
* **IDE (Development Environment):** Visual Studio Code (Recommended)
* **Package Management:** Pip and requirements.txt
* **Version Control:** Git and GitHub

### **2.2. Artificial Intelligence and LLM Services**

* **Large Language Model (LLM):** API-based models that will serve as the agent's brain.
  * **High-Performance Models:**
    * **Main Recommendation: Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (Currently the best choice for speed, cost, and reasoning balance).
    * **Alternative: OpenAI GPT-4o** (Another powerful high-performance option).
  * **Cost-Effective Models (For Smart Routing):**
    * **Main Recommendation: OpenAI GPT-4o mini** (Excellent for simple tasks with extremely low cost and surprisingly good performance).
    * **Alternative: Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku** (Another great option that's very fast and inexpensive).
* **Vector Database (For RAG - Stage 3):**
  * **Local/Free:** ChromaDB
  * **Cloud-Based/Scalable:** Pinecone, Weaviate
* **Observability and Debugging:**
  * **LangSmith:** Highly recommended for visualizing the agent's thought processes, tool usage, and API calls.

### **2.3. Dependencies for Custom Tools**

* **Git Integration:** GitPython
* **Code Analysis (Python):** ast

## **3. Cost Analysis**

### **3.1. Development Costs**

There is **almost no direct financial cost** for the initial development stages of the project.

### **3.2. Operational Costs (Most Important Part)**

#### **Main Cost Item: LLM API Usage**

LLMs are priced based on text units called tokens.

Current Price Estimates (as of October 2025, SUBJECT TO CHANGE):
WARNING: These prices can be changed by API providers at any time. Be sure to CHECK official pricing pages before starting development.

* **High-Performance Models:**
  * **Claude 3.5 Sonnet:** Input: ~$3.00 / 1M tokens | Output: ~$15.00 / 1M tokens
  * **GPT-4o:** Input: ~$5.00 / 1M tokens | Output: ~$15.00 / 1M tokens
* **Cost-Effective Models:**
  * **GPT-4o mini:** Input: **~$0.15 / 1M tokens** | Output: **~$0.60 / 1M tokens**
  * **Claude 3 Haiku:** Input: ~$0.25 / 1M tokens | Output: ~$1.25 / 1M tokens

Estimated Cost of a "README Generation" Task:
With a smart model routing strategy, this cost can be significantly reduced. Using Sonnet for complex steps and GPT-4o mini for simple steps, with a total consumption between 100,000 and 200,000 tokens:

* **Optimized Estimated Single-Use Cost:** **~$0.10 - $0.40**

#### **Cost Optimization Strategies**

* **Smart Model Routing:** This is the most important strategy. Use the right model for each step of the agent.
  * **Simple Tasks:** Use **GPT-4o mini** or **Claude 3 Haiku** for simple decision moments like file listing, "Is this file important?".
  * **Complex Tasks:** Switch to **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** for complex steps requiring consistency, such as deep code analysis and final document writing.
* **Caching:** Prevent unnecessary API calls by caching the results of repetitive operations.
* **Prompt Engineering:** Optimize the system prompt so the agent reaches the correct result in fewer steps.

#### **Other Potential Costs (At Commercialization Stage):**

* **Hosting/Server Costs:** Vercel, AWS, Google Cloud, etc.
* **Vector Database:** Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.
* **Domain:** Annual ~$10-15.

## **4. Budget-Friendly Roadmap for MVP**

1. **LLM Selection:** Get **free starter credits** from Anthropic or OpenAI.
2. **Application Type:** First develop the project as a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** tool.
3. **Vector Database:** Run **ChromaDB** on your local machine.
4. **Code Hosting:** Use a **free GitHub** repository.
5. **Observability:** Track your agent's steps using **LangSmith's free tier**.
