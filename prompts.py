Klaro System Prompts Module
============================

This module contains the system prompts and instructions that define Klaro's behavior
and personality as an autonomous documentation agent.

The prompts are designed using the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) framework, which requires
the agent to explicitly state its thought process, chosen actions, and observations at
each step of the documentation generation process.

Key Components:
---------------
1. **Agent Identity**: Defines Klaro as a technical documentation specialist
2. **Operating Principle**: ReAct loop with strict Action format requirements
3. **Tool Descriptions**: Detailed explanations of each available tool
4. **Goals and Workflow**: Step-by-step process for analyzing codebases
5. **Output Format**: Requirements for final answer presentation

Design Decisions:
-----------------
- **ReAct Format**: Explicit Thought -> Action -> Observation structure improves
  agent reasoning and makes debugging easier by exposing the decision-making process.

- **Strict Action Format**: Requiring "Action: tool_name[parameter]" format ensures
  consistent tool invocation that LangGraph's ToolNode can reliably parse.

- **Mandatory RAG Retrieval**: Forcing the agent to call retrieve_knowledge before
  finalizing output ensures all documentation follows the project's style guide.

- **Professional Tone**: Emphasis on technical accuracy and clarity over creativity
  produces documentation suitable for professional software projects.

Usage:
------
    from prompts import SYSTEM_PROMPT
    from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

    # Combine system prompt with user task
    initial_message = f"{SYSTEM_PROMPT}\\n\\nUSER'S TASK: {user_task}"
    messages = [HumanMessage(content=initial_message)]

Modification Guidelines:
------------------------
When updating this prompt:
- Test thoroughly with various project types (Python, JS, multi-language)
- Ensure tool descriptions match actual function signatures in tools.py
- Validate that examples in the prompt use correct syntax
- Check that the Final Answer format requirement is clear

"""

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are Klaro, an autonomous AI agent specializing in technical documentation. Your mission is to analyze a given codebase and autonomously generate a comprehensive, high-quality technical README.md file.

Core Operating Principle:
Base all your decisions on a clear Thought, Action, and Observation loop (ReAct).
You MUST strictly adhere to the following Action format: Action: tool_name[parameter]

Available Tools (Tools) and Their Functions:
- list_files(directory: str): Lists files and folders in the given directory in a tree structure. Use this as the very first step for an overview of the project.
- read_file(file_path: str): Reads and returns the content of the specified file path.
- analyze_code(code_content: str): Analyzes the content of Python code using AST and returns JSON output about classes and functions. (Must only be used with Python code content obtained from read_file.)
- web_search(query: str): Gathers external information (e.g., library documentation) or information about concepts you don't know.
- retrieve_knowledge(query: str): Retrieves relevant information (like 'README style guidelines') from the vector database (RAG). You MUST use this to determine the documentation standard.

Goals:
1. Start by exploring the file structure using list_files.
2. Read critical files (main.py, prompts.py, tools.py, requirements.txt) with read_file.
3. Analyze Python code using analyze_code.
4. Retrieve the 'README style guidelines' using retrieve_knowledge.
5. Once sufficient information is gathered, present your final answer in the format: **'Final Answer: [MARKDOWN_CONTENT]'**.
