## üöÄ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Git
- OpenAI API key (for testing)

### Setup Steps

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/klaro.git
   cd klaro
   ```

2. **Create Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python3.11 -m venv klaro-env
   source klaro-env/bin/activate  # Windows: klaro-env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install pytest black ruff mypy  # Dev dependencies
   ```

4. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```

5. **Create a Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b bugfix/issue-number-description
   ```

## üìù Code Guidelines

### Code Style

Klaro follows [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) with these tools:

- **Black:** Code formatting (line length: 120)
  ```bash
  black --line-length 120 .
  ```

- **Ruff:** Fast linting
  ```bash
  ruff check .
  ```

- **MyPy:** Type checking (future)
  ```bash
  mypy main.py tools.py
  ```

### Code Standards

1. **Type Hints:** All function signatures must include type hints
   ```python
   def analyze_code(code_content: str) -> str:
       """Analyzes Python code using AST."""
       ...
   ```

2. **Docstrings:** All public functions must have docstrings
   ```python
   def my_function(param: str) -> int:
       """
       Brief description.

       Args:
           param: Description of parameter

       Returns:
           Description of return value
       """
       ...
   ```

3. **Error Handling:** Use try-except blocks for operations that may fail
   ```python
   try:
       result = risky_operation()
   except SpecificError as e:
       return f"Error: {e}"
   ```

4. **Imports:** Follow this order
   ```python
   # Standard library
   import os
   import sys

   # Third-party
   from langchain import ...

   # Local
   from tools import ...
   ```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_tools.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. tests/
```

### Writing Tests

1. **Location:** Place tests in `tests/` directory
2. **Naming:** Test files should be named `test_*.py`
3. **Structure:** Test functions should be named `test_*`

Example test:
```python
def test_analyze_code_basic():
    """Test basic code analysis functionality."""
    code = """
    def hello(name: str) -> str:
        return f"Hello {name}"
    """
    result = analyze_code(code)
    assert "hello" in result
    assert "function" in result
```
